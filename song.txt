Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind
Not a yessir. not a follower

Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lighting before the thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lighting then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lighting then the thunder
Thunder. thunder
Thunder
Imagine Dragon
